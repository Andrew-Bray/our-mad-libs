ETHAN:
    i feel like making one input affect many words complicated this a little bit. also i think our labeling couldve been better as far as inputs v outputs. but i have no idea whats going on so maybe i just need everything explained like im 5. 

    anyway, i didnt get any red squiggles and you can sucessfully enter the words into the boxes and they appear in the poem. 

    good luck everyone!
