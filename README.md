ETHAN:
    i feel like making one input affect many words complicated this a little bit. also i think our labeling couldve been better as far as inputs v outputs. but i have no idea whats going on so maybe i just need everything explained like im 5. 

    anyway, i didnt get any red squiggles and you can sucessfully enter the words into the boxes and they appear in the poem. 

    good luck everyone! 

ANDREW:
    I got the basics running (the hidden classes, the event listeners triggering correctly), but then had a bit of fun playing with CSS. You are more than welcome to change things up, try other formats, different fonts, stylish time delays. Feel free to join me down the "googling rabbit hole" of how to make animations work.

    The state of the JS is a bit sloppy (forgive me), so if anyone is interested in refactoring, or at least organizing it, please go to it with my blessing!

    -some of the html spans for the output words isn't quite right. Each input and output could use some testing and cleaning.

    -The header needs a name, or it could be removed completely.

    take care friends!

Kevin:

    - Fixed ESLint recommendations, Double quotes --> single quotes for strings, indentation, etc.
    - Added more robust text transforms so user can input AnY VariATION Of TEXT LiKE tHis and it should format correctly
